"Stop scrolling. If you’re tired of feeling stuck – unable to quit bad habits or make good ones stick – then this is for you. By the end of this video, you'll uncover the incredibly simple, yet revolutionary reason why some people achieve extraordinary things, while others stay exactly where they are.

Maybe you’re in your twenties, your thirties, or even beyond. You look around and see others achieving incredible things – building businesses, getting fit, mastering new skills – yet you feel stuck. No matter how hard you try, those crucial habits just won't stick, and the bad ones seem impossible to break.

Now, I'll be honest, I'm usually skeptical of self-help books. Most feel like beautifully packaged lies. But then, I stumbled upon a concept – the '1% method' – that led me down a rabbit hole and straight to a book that changed everything for me: *Atomic Habits* by James Clear.

"
"This wasn't some random recommendation; it was an Instagram post that sparked my curiosity. That small clue sent me searching for the source, and page after page, I devoured *Atomic Habits*.

What hooked me wasn't just the logic, but how deeply it connected to our psychological state. As someone fascinated by psychology and sociology, the insights in this book resonated deeply, offering a truly logical framework for change.

At its core, *Atomic Habits* isn't about grand gestures; it’s about forming simple daily habits with surprisingly powerful impacts. But to do that, we first need to understand the very mechanics of how habits are formed.

So, what exactly is an 'Atomic Habit'? Let's break down the title. A habit is an activity or behavior performed regularly, often automatically. An 'atom' is the smallest, irreducible part of something.

Combine those two, and you get a powerful concept:"
" an atomic habit is a tiny change, a minuscule part of a larger system, yet it holds immense cumulative power over time.

The book is built upon four foundational steps, which the author calls the 'backbone' of atomic habits. These are, in sequence: Cue, Craving, Response, and Reward. We'll explore each one and how they weave into the fabric of your daily life.

But first, let me tell you about a team that was once the laughingstock of the sports world: the English cycling team. For over a century, since 1908, they'd only won a single Olympic medal.

Their performance was so abysmal, bicycle manufacturers actually refused to sell them equipment, fearing it would tarnish their brand! Imagine being *that* bad.

Then came a new coach, Dave Brailsford, and he introduced a revolutionary philosophy: the 'aggregation of marginal gains.' This was the strategy that first grabbed my attention, and it's something you *need* to understand.

"
"Brailsford's idea was simple: if you break down *everything* related to cycling – from the bike's color and weight to the rider's helmet, clothing, even the quality of their bedding – and improve each tiny element by just 1%, the combined effect would be monumental.

He and his team meticulously redesigned bike parts, optimized routines for handwashing, sleep, and more. Individually, these changes seemed insignificant. But together, they began to make a noticeable difference.

After every race, they'd analyze problems, making small 1-2% improvements. The result? Within five years, this once-ridiculed team dominated the Beijing Olympics, and a cascade of victories followed.

So, what was their secret? Did these simple habits and tiny improvements *really* allow them to outperform the world's best? **The answer will redefine your understanding of success.**

James Clear sums it up perfectly:"
" ""If you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up 37 times better at what you do. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day, you’ll decline to almost zero.""

This means that whether you start with a small gain or a small loss, it accumulates into something far greater than you can imagine. The tiny differences compound.

Think about it: the gap between someone who improves just a little and someone who gets a little lazier can be massive after a year or two. Yet, you won't see that dramatic result in the moment.

Success isn't a single decision; it’s the sum of thousands of small decisions you make daily. Consistency, not perfection or even the goal itself, is the true key.

There's an old Iraqi proverb that says, 'Much water carves rock.' Even the smallest, most consistent drops can eventually create enormous change. Your habits, good or bad, are carving your future.

"
"The accumulations of your actions and habits have two very different outcomes. They are either propelling you forward or holding you back.

Take a moment to consider the negative things you’re currently facing. Chances are, they are the result of many small, seemingly insignificant choices accumulating over a long period.

For example, that fatty, quick sandwich you grab every day? Once or twice, it’s no big deal. But accumulate that habit over two or three months, and suddenly, you've gained five kilos or more.

You've unwittingly accumulated a bad habit, leading to an unwanted outcome.

Now, imagine if you accumulated a small, good habit instead. What if you drank a glass of water every morning, or read just two pages of a book? After two or three months, you might notice your skin improved, or you've finished an entire book without even trying.

As James Clear says, ""The results you achieve are a lagging measure of your habits."
""" Your current life is simply a reflection of the habits you’ve consistently practiced.

So, this brings us to the crucial question: How do you actually form a good habit and get rid of a bad one? I know that’s what you’re all asking right now, and the answer is coming.

But here's a quick check: if you don’t have the patience to listen to this video until the end, how do you expect to form a good habit for your entire life? Stick with me, it’s worth it.

Let's agree on two things. Changing an old habit is like trying to uproot a massive, ancient tree with your bare hands – incredibly difficult. Starting a new habit, on the other hand, is like planting a delicate seedling.

That seedling needs care, water, vigilance, and protection to grow strong enough to stand on its own. Sounds about right, doesn't it? To do either, you'll inevitably encounter something called the 'Valley of Disappointment.'

Look at the chart on your screen."
" Don't worry, I'll explain. The X-axis is time, the Y-axis is results. That orange area? That’s your 'Valley of Disappointment.'

This valley, my friend, is where boredom, frustration, and the expectation of quick results collide with reality. You want instant gratification, but the results just aren't appearing on your timeline.

You hit the gym for a month, expecting to lose 10 kilos and build muscle, despite being overweight. When you don't see those dramatic changes, you enter this valley.

Or you've been on a diet for two months, and the scale hasn't budged a single gram. *Boom.* You're in the Valley of Disappointment. Most people give up right here, abandoning everything because they aren't seeing instant gratification.

But here's the truth: you need a realistic routine that helps you navigate and overcome this valley, so you can actually reach your goal. The mistake most people make is focusing on the goal *before* the method.

"
"That's why James Clear tells you: ""Forget about goals and focus on systems instead.""

You might be asking, 'What’s the difference?' Imagine you're a football coach. Your goal is to win a championship. But your *system* is the daily training routine you commit to in order to achieve that goal.

Or consider a student. The goal is to succeed and get a high average. But the *system* is reading from the beginning of the semester, preparing assignments, preventing work from piling up. The good result, in the end, becomes an inevitable outcome.

Since we live in the present, it’s far more effective to focus on your system, not just the ultimate goal. While goals are crucial for direction, focusing *only* on success is often the beginning of failure.

Success isn't a single event; it's the cumulative result of consistent actions over time. I bet I’ve already shifted your perspective a little, haven't I?"
" Making you see the power of the system over the lure of the goal.

The goal itself is fixed, waiting for you. But it's the *system* that brings you progress. Plus, your final goal might not even be your *actual* goal, or it could be just one part of much larger aspirations.

So, creating a robust system and committing to it is the surest path to achieving the results you desire.

James Clear warns of four problems you'll face if you only focus on goals. Let's dive into them.

**Problem #1: Winners and losers often have the same goal.** Every football team, every competitor, aims to win. But the one with the most precise and effective *system* is the one who ultimately triumphs.

Every student wants to succeed. But only those with the right *system* actually achieve it. It's not the goal that separates success from failure; it’s the system that guides them there. Are you with me?

**Problem #2:"
" Achieving a goal is merely a momentary change.** Imagine your room is a mess – clothes everywhere, empty cups under the bed. Your goal is a clean room, right? You clean it, you achieve your goal. But that’s only a *momentary* change.

If you don't commit to the *system* that keeps it clean, your room will inevitably revert to its old state, or even worse. We often trick ourselves into thinking the goal *itself* will change our lives for the better.

But it's the *system* – the method you use to keep your room tidy – that truly transforms your life. Stick to that method, and your life gets better, not just your clean room.

**Problem #3: Goals limit your happiness.** The unspoken assumption behind many goals is: 'Once I achieve this, *then* I'll be happy.' This mindset forces you to postpone happiness until some future date, which can lead to increased frustration during the journey.

Why trap yourself in this mental cage?"
" Why confine your mind to such a narrow scope? It makes no sense! Whether you're a student, a business owner, or anything else, waiting until you 'succeed' to allow yourself happiness is a self-imposed prison.

What about the journey? Are you going to torture yourself until you reach the destination? That's not logical, is it? Don't let your goals restrict your freedom or your happiness. Instead, enjoy the process.

The final goal is simply a matter of time and consistent action through the system we're discussing. **Stay tuned, because the next problem will fundamentally change how you view 'success.'**

**Problem #4: Goals conflict with long-term progress.** The author calls this the 'yo-yo effect.' Think of a yo-yo: you throw it down, and it comes back up. The goal drives you forward, but once you reach it, what then?

Often, you might even lose interest, or not truly enjoy the achievement."
" Imagine you train for bodybuilding, aiming for a certain physique within a year. You achieve it, you win a championship. And then what?

Without a system to *continue*, you'll likely revert to old habits. Have you noticed how many football players, after retiring, quickly gain weight or neglect their health? Or how most people who lose weight often gain it back?

If your goal was to go from 90kg to 70kg, and you achieved it through a healthy system over a year, but then stopped – your weight will creep back up. You didn't learn the *system* for maintaining that weight, the continuous habits needed.

This brings us back to the power of the *Atomic Habits* system itself. If you're struggling to change habits or create new ones, the problem isn't *you*; it's the *system* you're currently using.

Before we dive deeper into the nuts and bolts of habit formation, let's quickly summarize what we've covered so far."
" This is crucial for building a strong foundation.

1.  Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Even a 1% daily improvement creates tremendous long-term impact.
2.  Habits are a double-edged sword: they either work for you or against you. Invest your time wisely in the right ones.
3.  Small changes often seem insignificant until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful results of any cumulative process appear late, so patience is paramount.
4.  An atomic habit is a small habit that's part of a larger, interconnected system.
5.  To achieve better results, forget about setting goals, and instead, focus relentlessly on your system.

Now, let's explore a fascinating concept: How do habits shape your identity, and vice versa? According to James Clear, there are three levels of change, and they’re all interconnected. Look at the chart on your screen.

These levels are:"
" changing results, changing processes, and changing identity. Let's break them down.

**Level 1: Changing Results.** These are your goals – wanting to succeed, win a championship, publish a book. They're the outcomes you set for yourself.

**Level 2: Changing Processes.** This involves changing the systems or routines you follow to reach your desired goal. Most habit formation strategies start here.

**Level 3: Changing Identity.** This is the deepest and most crucial level. It’s about changing your beliefs, your thoughts, your self-image, and the judgments you make about yourself. Most of our core beliefs are rooted in our identity.

In James Clear's view, this is the single most important part of forming *any* new habit. And I'm about to show you why.

Now, pay close attention to the two charts on your screen."
" If you start by focusing on changing results, working from the 'outside-in,' your habit change will likely be messy, and you’ll probably give up halfway.

Why? Because you're only focused on the goal, not who you need to *become*. However, if you follow the right approach – focusing on identity, your beliefs, and your perspective – you’ll build habits that last a lifetime.

Once you truly believe in an idea and integrate it into your identity, the habit becomes effortless. No complaining, no abandoning it halfway. Still sounds a bit abstract? Let me give you a clear example.

Imagine two smokers trying to quit. The first one, following the 'outside-in' approach, is offered a cigarette and says, 'I'm trying to quit smoking, so no thanks.' Nothing wrong with that, right? But his mindset is still that of a smoker.

Now, the second person, who focused on changing their identity, responds: 'Thanks, I don't smoke."
"' Do you feel the difference? That subtle shift in language reveals a complete change in mindset.

This simple difference highlights the gap between someone who changes their *belief* about themselves, versus someone who only focuses on the *final result* while their mind and heart are still attached to the old habit.

James Clear emphasizes: ""It’s hard to change your habits unless you change the beliefs that led you to that habit."" True behavioral change begins with changing your identity, then aligning your routine system to reach your desired result.

The more you repeat a certain behavior, the more it becomes ingrained as a habit, and in turn, it becomes a part of your identity. For instance, if you genuinely believe reading will improve you, you'll create a system to read a few pages daily.

As a result, you become a reader. Your identity shifts. Your new actions vote for who you truly are."
" **This next quote from the book will stick with you forever.**

James Clear says: ""Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.""

Every action you repeatedly perform, good or bad, ultimately shapes your personality and identity. That's why people evolve their behaviors and actions as they age or go through life-changing experiences.

Your mind is constantly in a voting process. So, decide now: What do you want to become a year from now? What qualities will you cultivate? Cast your votes wisely, starting today, to become that future self.

Let’s quickly recap this vital chapter before moving to the practical implementation.

1.  There are three levels of change: results, processes, and identity.
2."
"  The most effective way to change habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on what you want to *become*.
3.  Your identity stems from your habits. Every action is a vote for the person you want to become.
4.  To achieve your ideal self-image, you need to continuously refine your beliefs and expand your identity.
5.  The real reason habits matter isn't just the results they bring, but their power to change your beliefs about yourself.

In this next chapter, I'm going to fundamentally change your perspective on habit formation. Stay with me, because this is where theory meets practical application.

A habit is a repeated action that eventually becomes automatic. And building habits begins with learning from our experiences, especially our mistakes.

Every time you encounter something new, your brain enters a 'feedback loop.' You test solutions, consciously or unconsciously, until you find a satisfactory result."
" During this, your brain is incredibly active, performing complex operations.

Your mind works overtime to understand, analyze, and provide solutions based on your past experiences and knowledge. It's a lot of mental effort, right?

Let me simplify this with an example before I give you the four steps. Remember learning to drive? Your first lessons were chaotic: cars, horns, hands everywhere, feet on pedals, eyes darting between mirrors. Pure sensory overload.

Your mind was desperately trying to process new information. Since you had no prior driving habit, you over-exhausted your brain. But after a while, you started driving almost unconsciously.

Your senses work automatically. You brake without thinking, signal effortlessly, and your mind is free to wander. Suddenly, there's no energy consumption. Am I right?

So, what's the point? Many people misunderstand habits. They think, 'A habit restricts me, takes my time, exhausts me."
"' But if you truly think about it, a habit *frees* you.

It frees your mind, allowing you to perform actions automatically, without conscious thought. See how I just flipped your thinking? Whose mind is more exhausted: the one struggling to learn something new, or the one operating on ingrained habits?

Behavioral psychologist Jason Hreha says: ""Habits are simply reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment."" Every habit you form, that becomes part of your identity, frees your mind to focus on other, more complex things.

This creates behavioral 'accumulations' through trial and error. If you have a reading habit, for instance, you'll analyze more problems and information faster, with less effort.

Habits are mental shortcuts, learned from experience, helping your mind remember past solutions to avoid or improve upon them in the future. **Pay attention, because this next insight about your conscious mind is critical.**

"
"The process of habit formation is incredibly beneficial for your conscious mind. Imagine your mind as a bottle. Your conscious mind is only the narrow neck.

You can't think and analyze multiple problems simultaneously. Your brain's priority is keeping you safe and maintaining conscious attention, as that's more important than any other task.

But then you'll say, 'I solve many things, and decisions come to me that I hadn't even thought about!' My friend, that's your *subconscious* mind at work. Your conscious mind delegates authority to it.

The subconscious thinks and analyzes based on your experiences, accumulations, and habits, all without overwhelming your conscious mind. But without good habits and a correct system, you burden your conscious mind, leading to exhaustion.

So, habits reduce cognitive load, freeing up mental capacity to pay attention to multiple tasks at the same time. James Clear tells you:"
" ""Building habits in the present allows you to do what you want in the future.""

Now, let's explore the four fundamental stages of habits: Cue, Craving, Response, and Reward. This sequence is the backbone of every habit, and your brain processes them in exactly this order.

**Stage 1: The Cue.** This alerts your brain to start a specific behavior; it's information predicting a certain reward. The cue then triggers the second stage...

**Stage 2: The Craving.** Physiologically, craving and desire are the driving force behind every habit. It's human nature: without incentives or desires, you simply won’t act.

Crucially, you don't crave *smoking* a cigarette; you crave the *feeling* it gives you. You don't long to *brush your teeth*; you long for the feeling of a clean, fresh mouth *after* the process.

You don't long to *lift weights*; you crave the feeling you get *after* a workout. Apply this to any action:"
" you crave the *result* of the action, not the action itself.

The intensity of the craving varies from person to person, depending on the importance of the initial cue. For a gambler, the sound of a slot machine is a powerful cue. For me, it means nothing.

For a smoker, the sound of a lighter can trigger a powerful craving. But for a non-smoker, it's meaningless. Cues only gain meaning once they are *interpreted* by your mind, and *you* decide their importance.

**Stage 3: The Response.** This is the action itself. Here, you decide whether to perform the action after the cue and craving, or to abandon it. Most of the time, if an action is unpleasant, difficult, or requires too many steps, you simply won’t do it.

**Stage 4: The Reward.** The reward is what we often seek without effort. James Clear highlights two benefits of the reward. First, it satisfies the craving, giving us that sought-after dopamine rush.

"
"Second, it *teaches* us. Your brain is a reward-seeking device, constantly monitoring for pleasures that satisfy your desires and provide dopamine. These feelings of pleasure and frustration are part of the feedback mechanism, helping you distinguish useful actions from unhelpful ones.

The reward is the final stage, closing the feedback loop and completing your habit cycle. Any deficiency in these four parts will prevent a habit from forming consistently. If you eliminate the cue, the loop won't even start.

If the cue is present, but the craving is weak, you won't respond. The habit will be abandoned. This habit loop operates constantly, analyzing your environment, predicting events, and generating responses based on your experiences—all in a fraction of a second.

Let me give you an example of how you can break a bad habit by analyzing it with these four steps. Look at the table on your screen."
" The first two stages are the 'problem stages,' and the last two are the 'solution stages.'

Take smoking: The cue is the sound of a lighter. The craving is the desire for the feeling smoking gives you. To satisfy that craving, you move to the solution stage, the 'response': you take a cigarette and light it. The 'reward' is the temporary relief.

This system applies to both good and bad habits. Understanding this gives you the power to control them. **But how do you *actually* apply this to your daily life? That's what we'll uncover next.**

Now, let's turn to the Four Laws of Behavior Change. Look at this table. For building a *good* habit, we need to make the Cue obvious, the Craving attractive, the Response easy, and the Reward satisfying.

For breaking a *bad* habit, we simply reverse these: make the Cue invisible, the Craving unattractive, the Response difficult, and the Reward unsatisfying."
" Let's start with making the Cue 'obvious' for good habits.

**Law 1: Make it Obvious (or Invisible for bad habits)**

Imagine you want to start reading a book. But every time, you get lazy: walking to the shelf, pulling out the book, finding a quiet spot. The process is too long; you forget, or just lose motivation.

The cue that should motivate you to read is buried under too much friction. So, what’s the fix? Place the book right by your bed *before* you sleep.

Now, every time you enter your room, there it is – an obvious, easy cue. You can immediately pick it up and start reading. With consistency, this becomes automatic.

Another example: forgetting to drink water or take medicine. Why? Because it’s out of sight, in a drawer, or far away. It’s normal! I’ve been there.

If water isn't within arm's reach, you won't drink it unless you’re parched."
" So, fill water bottles and strategically place them around your house, especially where you spend most of your time, or in your car.

You do this once, and suddenly, the cues are everywhere, making it easy to drink water and stick to the habit. The same goes for medicine: if you wash your face first thing, put the medicine box by the sink. If you put on perfume, place it by your perfume bottle.

There's a crucial quote here, one I've personally experienced: ""It is easier to change habits in new surroundings."" And it’s profoundly true.

I quit smoking during a health crisis, but the environment I was in played a massive role. There were no cues – no coffee shelf, no library, nothing to remind me of cigarettes. This made forgetting smoking remarkably easy.

James Clear tells you: ""You live in a world designed for you by others. So its cues influence you, and it takes your responses to these cues for its own benefit.""

"
"Think about a supermarket. It’s designed to trick your eyes, placing products at eye level, making aisles comfortable to walk. They create easy, obvious cues to make you buy specific products.

Similarly, clinics, streets, any public place – they’re all designed to stimulate specific cues within you. And yet, your own home, which *you* control, often works against you because you haven't designed it for good habits.

You might struggle to quit smoking or stick to reading, blaming your 'brain' when really, you just need to design an environment where the right cues are clear and inescapable.

To get rid of a bad habit, you simply reverse the process: make the cue difficult or invisible. Don't put triggers for bad behavior in front of you.

If you habitually link coffee with a cigarette every morning, hide the cigarette pack or keep it far away."
" Move the coffee machine to a different spot, adding one or two extra steps to your coffee ritual.

Little by little, these increased 'triggers' will make you too lazy to complete the feedback loop, and you'll naturally reduce or quit the smoking habit.

James Clear shares this powerful insight: ""Those who suffer from a lack of self-control have the same feelings as people who are self-controlled. The difference is that the self-controlled person is simply distanced from those cues and triggers, nothing more.""

Someone committed to the gym removes junk food triggers from their home. Someone who quit smoking removes cigarette triggers. It’s not about superhuman willpower; it’s about environmental design. It really works, I can tell you from personal experience.

So, that's the first law: make the cue obvious for good habits, or invisible for bad ones. Now, let's move to the second law, related to craving and desire.

**Law 2:"
" Make it Attractive (or Unattractive for bad habits)**

We're going to make the craving attractive for good habits, and unattractive for bad ones. Scientifically, your mind is stimulated by anything that looks good, is large, and has clear, vibrant colors. This is called 'supernormal stimuli.'

That’s why cosmetic surgeries exaggerate features, making everything larger – because the mind is wired to be stimulated this way. Supernormal stimuli are enhanced versions of reality.

Think of hamburger ads: sandwiches the size of a football, with vibrant colors. Furniture ads. They all trigger your brain's reward centers. This behavior is inherent in humans. But exaggerating these triggers leads to addiction to harmful habits.

The author notes: ""Bad behavior is self-reinforcing."" When you see such ads, your craving mechanism kicks in. The cue (hamburger picture) leads to the craving (desire to eat it).

"
"A clear cue and an attractive craving create a powerful motivator for action. So, how do we make a craving *less* impactful? We make the desire unattractive.

If I crave a cigarette, I must hide it from sight. If I constantly see it, I'll keep craving it and returning to smoking. When your craving increases, your expectation for the reward heightens.

You see a sandwich while hungry, and you're already imagining devouring it. To make the desire unattractive, diet coaches advise small, frequent meals. This keeps you feeling full, reducing the craving for that intense 'devouring' reward.

Conversely, to build a good habit, make the craving incredibly attractive. And make the triggers strong and clear. The more attractive the desire, the sweeter the reward, the easier the habit is to stick to.

This is why phone addiction, Reels, and TikTok are so prevalent. They exploit the dopamine system, offering attractive and easy rewards."
" Dopamine is a hormone linked to pleasure and happiness.

But anything in excess becomes harmful. Overstimulating your pleasure and dopamine centers ingrains habits, good or bad. Dopamine can be a powerful ally or a destructive force.

Let me tell you the fascinating story of the mouse and dopamine, directly from the book. In 1954, neuroscientists James Olds and Peter Milner experimented on mice, implanting electrodes in their brains to stop dopamine secretion.

They discovered that without dopamine, the mice lost all desire to eat, drink, or have sex. They had no desire for *anything* at all. But here's the kicker: in a second experiment, they stopped dopamine but gave the mice a sweet sugar solution.

The mice *still enjoyed* the taste, just as they had before dopamine was stopped. This revealed a profound truth: without dopamine, the *enjoyment* of the reward is still present, but the *desire* that makes you crave the result *dies*.
"
"
Meaning, without the triggers and the dopamine hit, your brain won’t tell you, 'Go smoke,' or 'Go eat sweets.' The less desire you have for a bad habit, the smoother your path to quitting it.

Dopamine isn't just secreted *during* pleasure; it's released even when you *imagine* pleasure. This anticipation fuels the craving, making it stronger.

Think of waiting for a reward, a salary, or a gift. The *waiting* period itself is often more pleasurable and releases dopamine for longer than actually receiving the reward.

In fact, studies show 100% of the brain's pleasure centers activate when you're *expecting* or *craving* a reward, compared to only 10% when you actually *get* it. See the huge difference?

James Clear states: ""Desire is the primary driver of behavior."" So, how do we harness this desire for good? **Get ready, because this next technique will revolutionize how you approach new habits.**

"
"What if you want to perform a necessary behavior but lack the routine to sustain it? James Clear teaches a powerful method: link the behavior you *need* to do with a behavior you *already like* to do.

Let's say you want to start reading books, a behavior you *need* to establish. But you struggle to find the time. Link it to an old habit you already have, like watching TV every day at 7:00 PM.

Now, commit to reading for half an hour *before* your TV show, say from 6:30 to 7:00. Your reward? Watching TV afterward. With consistency, this process effortlessly builds a daily reading habit.

Link any task you're lazy about with a task you do every day. The anticipation of the reward – that TV show, that coffee – is what primarily motivates us, not the reward itself.

Another example: you like tidying your room and showering in the morning, but you feel lazy. You already drink coffee or tea every morning."
" So, before your coffee, tell yourself: 'I will tidy the room and shower, *then* I'll make my coffee or tea.'

And if you don't tidy up, you don't drink your favorite beverage. It'll feel like a burden at first. But with consistency, the pleasure of anticipating your tea will motivate you while you tidy. You'll even crave that cardamom tea while you're showering!

You can apply this 'habit stacking' system to every habit you want to form, or even merge habits together. This principle is called 'Premack’s Principle': a more probable behavior reinforces a less probable behavior.

**Law 3: Make it Easy (or Difficult for bad habits)**

We've covered making the cue obvious and the craving attractive. Now for the third law: Make the response easy. The response is the actual action of the habit.

For a new habit to succeed, or for you to respond effectively to a cue, the action must be *easy* to perform. Don’t get lost here:"
" repetition is key to any habit, good or bad.

Easy repetition often leads us to commit to bad habits. Think about your phone and social media: browsing barely expends any energy. Yet, many of us are semi-addicted.

It's an easy, satisfying habit, repeated over 50 times a day (at minimum for most). This creates a chronic habit that's incredibly difficult to break – all due to the *easy* response.

Now, imagine if you left your phone in another room. You’d get lazy to get up every few minutes to browse, because the action has become *difficult*. The more difficult you make the response to an action, the easier it is to quit a bad habit.

If cigarettes are in your pocket, you'll smoke frequently because the response is easy. But what if, every time you wanted a cigarette, you had to go to your room on the second floor, get the pack, then walk to the end of the street to smoke it?

I bet you'd regret ever starting!"
" In Sweden, smoking bans are imposed in apartments, restaurants, public places. This dramatically reduced my morning smoking, especially in cold weather with snow, and huge fines for smoking indoors.

Imagine implementing such a system in your own home! All this simply because you made the action or response *slightly* more difficult.

Let's summarize these crucial points before we move on:
1.  Any easy and accessible behavior is more likely to be followed and sustained. Make new habits easy to perform.
2.  Stack new habits onto an old, daily habit. Don't link a new habit to one you do only two or three times a week, or it won’t stick.
3.  For any bad habit you want to break, make it difficult. Remove the ease.
4.  Design your environment – your home, workplace – to be compatible with your new habits, facilitating their continuous occurrence.

"
"Now, let's talk about James Clear’s brilliant 'Two-Minute Rule' for building more effective habits. We often overcomplicate new habits, striving for the 'ideal' time and way, which makes them difficult and unsustainable.

But the problem isn't the habit itself; it's the initial action that triggers it. If you want to make running a daily routine, start by making the *starting action* easy: simply take out your running shoes and put them on.

Once they're on, your body will do the rest. You don't need to convince yourself or worry about the actual running. Or, make the running habit itself just two minutes, no more.

Want to start reading? Commit to reading for only two minutes. Make the book easy to access, perhaps by your bed. Your routine becomes: get into bed, read for two minutes, and *stop* after two minutes, even if you want to keep going.

It sounds counterintuitive, forcing yourself to stop."
" But after a few days, this habit will become part of your identity. You’ll see yourself as a 'reader' or an 'athlete.' And from there, you’ll naturally start setting bigger goals – five minutes, then ten.

Gradually, the habit ingrains itself, and you begin to love it. You’re not asked to finish a book in one sitting or run a marathon on your first day. That only destroys motivation. We make it two minutes because it becomes incredibly easy.

So, the rule is simple: make starting the habit easy, and then perform it for just two minutes. Don't overcomplicate it; simplify, and the rest will follow. **But what if you want to make bad habits *impossible*?**

In 1830, the French writer Victor Hugo had a book deadline looming. He was procrastinating, busy with other projects. As the deadline approached, he took drastic action.

He gathered all his clothes, asked his assistant to lock them in a closet, take the key, and leave."
" With nothing to wear, he was forced to stay home every day and write.

Before the publisher’s deadline, his masterpiece, 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame,' was born. James Clear's lesson here is profound: ""Sometimes success is not about making good habits easy, as much as it is about making bad habits difficult.""

Do you understand what this means? If you tend to overspend, don't carry your wallet. Okay, kidding! But try to reduce the amount of cash you take with you.

If you smoke a lot at the cafe, take only two cigarettes and leave the pack at home. Don't ask for more. If you spend too much time watching TV, unplug it and move it after each viewing session.

When you want to turn it back on, you'll be too lazy because of the extra steps. Make unhelpful actions as inaccessible as possible. With consistency, you will abandon them.

You’re creating a 'commitment device' – a decision you make now that controls your future actions."
" In fact, 40 to 50% of our daily lives are governed by our commitment to habits, good and bad.

These critical moments, these initial decisions, determine our daily activities. So be aware of what you're doing, and the results you're setting yourself up for.

Simply being aware of your actions will help you build your own system, transforming you into a better person. Remember the 1% rule? Apply it to anything in your life, no matter how small.

After two months, a year, you’ll see significant development. You'll love yourself exponentially more. These methods aren't just for you; apply them with your family and children. Motivate each other.

You can review this video, or read the book for deeper detail. Now, there are some actions you take just *once* that create long-term habits. Like canceling your Netflix subscription or TV packages.

You do it once, but the effect of reducing your TV watching is long-lasting."
" Remove the TV from your bedroom if you watch there; put it in another room. Again, less TV.

Most of us have our phones in our hands almost 24/7, leading to endless scrolling. So, put your phone on silent mode. Learn to keep it in your pocket, not in your hand.

At home, place your phone far away, not where you usually sit. The moment you pick up your device, consider half an hour lost to Instagram or TikTok.

This is useless time, especially for the younger generation, many of whom are addicted without realizing it leads to 'brain rot,' creating lazy habits that affect their maturation. You might find yourself with adolescent behaviors even in your thirties, due to weak communication and screen addiction.

If you've made it this far, consider yourself among the fortunate few. You've heard information that can enlighten and benefit you immensely. **But there's an ironic twist to all this technology.**

"
"You can actually use technology to your advantage for monthly or annual habits. Automate bill payments, set reminders for appointments, or use budgeting apps for expense analysis instead of manual tracking.

The more you can delegate habits to technology, and the more habits you perform automatically without thinking, the more your mind is freed up for other things, boosting your intellectual and practical productivity.

Philosopher Alfred Whitehead said: ""Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.""

I told you earlier: the easier and more accessible a habit is, the more addictive it becomes. Tech platforms like YouTube, Google, and TikTok are masters at reading your psychology through algorithms.

When a YouTube video ends, the next one starts automatically. No clicks, no effort. Netflix does the same. This keeps you watching longer, effortlessly."
" They are experts at subtly stealing your time.

This seemingly trivial automation leads to wasted time, preventing you from doing things like going to the gym or cleaning your house. Be aware of these subtle forces, especially from capitalist companies controlling our commercial, mental, and psychological markets.

We rarely allow ourselves to feel bored. The instant a dull sensation hits, we grab our phones. But here’s the secret: boredom is the birthplace of creativity, discovery, and development.

When you let distractions steal your time and mind, you're getting quick dopamine hits, but you're not producing anything useful for yourself or your surroundings. Just instant gratification with no lasting benefit.

Imagine if Kant, Freud, and Durkheim were glued to social media. Would they have given us anything profound? Ask yourself why we see fewer philosophers today."
" It’s largely due to these distractions, primarily social media – a truly frightening tool.

Now, we come to the final, fourth law of behavior change.

**Law 4: Make it Satisfying (or Unsatisfying for bad habits)**

This law tells you: Make the outcome satisfying if it's a good habit, and make the outcome trivial or unsatisfying if it's a bad habit.

James Clear says: ""A behavior that is immediately rewarded is repeated. And a behavior that is immediately punished is avoided."" What does this truly mean? Let me grab a quick drink of water.

Our ancient ancestors, Homo sapiens from over 200,000 years ago, had the same brain we have now. They focused on immediate survival: what to eat, how to protect themselves *right now*.

They didn't plan for rewards a year or two later. Like any wild animal, their concern was immediate food and safety. This wired our brains for powerful immediate reward centers.

"
"Even modern humans crave immediate gratification. We want everything *now*. We smoke for immediate relaxation, despite long-term harm. We eat unhealthy food for instant taste and pleasure, ignoring future consequences.

We rarely think about delayed gratification, even though the rule states: ""The more immediate pleasure an action brings, the more you should question whether it aligns with your long-term goals.""

So for a habit to stick, it needs strong satisfaction. Some habits have low immediate satisfaction, but their long-term results are far superior to those that give instant gratification.

Think about chewing gum. When first invented, it was tasteless and had low demand. But once flavors were added, the immediate reward became satisfying and delicious, and sales exploded.

The manufacturers understood how to make the satisfaction obvious, especially by linking oral cleanliness and mint flavor."
" People started chewing for an immediate feeling of clean teeth, even though mint has no chemical relation to cleaning them.

Toothpaste companies do the same. Coca-Cola spent years studying the amount of fizz and the sound of opening a can, all to convey an immediate feeling of refreshment and gratification.

Remember those Coca-Cola ads with the distinct sound of a can opening and fizzing? They know how your instincts and mind work. That's why most large companies employ psychological and public relations consultants.

You might wonder, 'What's the connection?' Their job is to study you, the individual, within society, to turn you into a consuming client. It's all about making that satisfaction clear and immediate.

So, how do we harness this innate love for immediate rewards for our benefit? I'm about to completely change your thinking with these next steps.

Humans love immediate rewards, right?"
" And because of that, it’s hard to quit a bad habit, as quitting doesn't offer an immediate reward. So, how do we reverse this to our advantage?

Let me show you. Take the habit of eating out, which leads to weight gain. It gives you a nice, immediate feeling. You can open a savings account, or even just a piggy bank.

Every time you decide *not* to eat at a restaurant (if you usually eat out daily, for example), make your meal at home. Then, transfer or put aside the money you would have spent.

After a month, you'll see a very nice sum accumulated. Here, you've made the satisfaction *obvious*; you're seeing the money grow right in front of you. You can do this with cigarettes too: every pack you *don't* smoke, transfer its cost.

In places like Sweden or Europe, a pack costs $5-10. Saving that daily would accumulate $300 a month – a very clear and satisfying reward."
" Even if cigarettes are cheaper where you are, seeing that money accumulate makes a difference.

The key is to *see* the money you save, making your rewards satisfying and clear, while simultaneously quitting a bad habit. You can apply this system to almost all your bad habits.

Let's summarize this chapter before we move to the final, critical part of this episode.

1.  The fourth law of behavior change is: Make it satisfying.
2.  We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is immediately satisfying.
3.  Despite human evolution, our brain still prioritizes immediate rewards over delayed ones.
4.  The main rule for behavior change is: ""Behavior that is immediately rewarded is repeated, and behavior that is immediately punished is avoided.""
5.  To make a habit last, you need a feeling of immediate success, even if it's a small one.
6."
"  The first three laws (Make it obvious, attractive, easy) increase the probability of a behavior happening *this time*. The fourth law (Make it satisfying) increases the probability of it being repeated *next time*.

Now, for the final, crucial message of this episode. No human is perfect. We often believe that if we can't do something perfectly, there's no point in doing it at all. And that's a dangerous lie.

Building or breaking habits is a gradual process; mistakes *will* happen. But the author's powerful rule is: ""Never miss twice.""

Falling off track is expected due to life's circumstances. But the key is to return to the habit as quickly as possible. Don't let a single slip turn into laziness that forces you to restart all your efforts.

Consistency is the true bedrock of every habit. Even if you don't feel like a full hour at the gym, tell yourself, 'I'll go for 10 minutes and come back."
"' And *actually* go for 10 minutes, then leave.

It's not the end of the world. You had a bad day, you're not in the mood. We're all human. Those ten minutes won't instantly build muscle, but they *will* strengthen your identity as an athletic person.

And that, in the long run, through consistent repetition, will solidify the habit within you, making it a routine. So, remember: consistency, even if it feels without immediate benefit, is a crucial factor in building any new habit.

Your future self is built one tiny, consistent action at a time. The choice is yours: what tiny habit will you start casting your vote for today?"
