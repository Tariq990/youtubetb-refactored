## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-17

### Added - Major Refactoring

#### Architecture
- Implemented Clean Architecture with Hexagonal Architecture pattern
- Created clear separation of concerns across layers (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation)
- Introduced Ports and Adapters pattern for external integrations

#### Exception System
- Comprehensive exception hierarchy with base `YouTubeTBException`
- Error codes for programmatic handling
- Severity levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- 6 recovery strategies (Retry, Retry with Backoff, Fallback, Circuit Breaker, Wait and Retry, None)
- Rich contextual information for debugging
- JSON serialization support

#### Logging System
- Structured logging with JSON output for machines
- Rich console output for humans
- Automatic log rotation
- Separate error log files
- Multiple log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)

#### Error Handling
- Centralized error handler with intelligent recovery
- Decorator-based error handling
- Circuit Breaker pattern for external services
- Exponential backoff for retries
- Error tracking and statistics
- Automatic notifications for critical errors

#### Monitoring & Metrics
- Performance metrics tracking
- Success/failure rate calculation
- Operation duration tracking (min, max, avg)
- System resource monitoring (CPU, Memory, Disk)
- Historical metrics storage

#### Output Management
- Unified output system with Rich formatting
- Progress bars with time estimation
- Formatted tables and panels

- Color-coded console output

#### Configuration
- Type-safe configuration with Pydantic
- Environment variable support
- Multiple environment support (dev, staging, prod)
- Automatic validation
- Centralized settings management

#### Documentation
- Comprehensive README with examples
- Architecture diagrams
- API documentation
- Developer guide
- User guide

### Changed

- Complete project restructure from monolithic to layered architecture
- Replaced print statements with structured logging
- Replaced generic exception handling with specific exception types
- Centralized configuration management
- Improved code organization and modularity

### Improved

- Code maintainability through SOLID principles
- Testability through dependency injection
- Error recovery through intelligent strategies
- System observability through comprehensive logging and metrics
- Developer experience through better documentation

### Technical Debt Addressed

- Removed hardcoded API keys
- Eliminated scattered print statements
- Fixed tight coupling between modules
- Removed duplicate code
- Improved error handling from basic try-except to intelligent recovery
