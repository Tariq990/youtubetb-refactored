## [2.1.0] - 2025-10-19

### Added - Intelligent Batch Processing

#### Core Features
- **Smart Batch Processing System**: Process multiple books automatically from text file
  - Analyzes all books before processing (pre-flight check)
  - Skips already completed books (`status="done"`)
  - Resumes incomplete books from last successful stage (`status="processing"`)
  - Processes new books from scratch
  - No duplicate work - fully database-aware

#### User Interface
- **Pre-Flight Plan Display**: Shows beautiful Rich table with planned actions before execution
  - Book name, status, action (skip/resume/process), and details
  - Color-coded for easy understanding (Green=done, Yellow=incomplete, Blue=new)
  - Summary statistics (total books, skip count, resume count, process count)
  
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress for each book during batch processing
  - Book X/Y indicator
  - Current action (skip/resume/process)
  - Success/failure status
  
- **Final Summary Table**: Comprehensive results display using Rich formatting
  - Total books, success count (new), success count (resumed), failed count, skipped count
  - Percentage breakdown
  - Detailed lists for each category with YouTube URLs
  - Failed books with error messages

#### CLI Enhancements
- **New Command**: `python -m src.presentation.cli.run_batch`
- **Command-Line Arguments**:
  - `--file <path>`: Custom books file (default: `books.txt`)
  - `--privacy <public|unlisted|private>`: YouTube privacy setting
  - `--no-skip`: Force re-processing of completed books
  - `--help`: Show usage information

#### Documentation
- **User Guide**: `BATCH_QUICK_START.md` - Quick start guide for users
- **Detailed Guide**: `docs/user-guide/BATCH_PROCESSING.md` - Comprehensive 500+ line documentation
  - Usage examples for all scenarios
  - Book file format with examples
  - How it works (step-by-step)
  - Advanced scenarios (all completed, multiple incomplete, handling failures)
  - Interruption handling (Ctrl+C)
  - Best practices and troubleshooting
  
- **Developer Guide**: `docs/developer/BATCH_PROCESSING_TECHNICAL.md` - Technical deep-dive
  - Architecture overview (3 key integrations)
  - Intelligent decision logic with code examples
  - Data flow diagrams
  - Error handling strategies
  - Performance considerations and future parallel processing design
  - API reference for all functions
  - Testing strategy (unit tests, integration tests, manual checklist)
  
- **Example Books**: `books_examples.txt` - 100+ book examples organized by category
  - Self-development, business, psychology, philosophy, health, communication, creativity, science
  - Arabic books section
  - Testing scenarios
  - Format examples and best practices

#### Testing
- **Test Suite**: `test_batch.py` - Automated testing script
  - Database book matching tests (case-insensitive, with/without author)
  - Status detection tests (new, completed, incomplete)
  - Batch file parsing tests
  - Database statistics display
  - All tests with visual output

#### Template Files
- `books.txt`: User-friendly template with examples and comments
- `books_examples.txt`: Extensive library of 100+ books for reference

### Changed

#### Database Integration
- Enhanced `check_book_exists()` usage in batch processor
- Case-insensitive title + author matching for accuracy
- Improved book matching logic (handles missing authors)

#### Pipeline Integration
- `run_pipeline.py` now receives batch processor calls via subprocess
- Database checks happen at two levels:
  1. Batch processor level (pre-flight analysis)
  2. Pipeline level (actual processing confirmation)

#### User Experience
- Rich library integration for beautiful tables and formatting
- Graceful degradation when Rich not available (fallback to plain text)
- Conditional imports to avoid errors when Rich not installed
- Better error messages and user guidance

### Fixed

#### Import Errors
- Fixed conditional Rich imports (added `RICH_AVAILABLE` flag)
- Local imports within functions to avoid `None` object calls
- Proper error handling when Rich components unavailable

#### Code Quality
- Fixed lint errors in `run_batch.py` (conditional imports)
- Updated type hints for better IDE support
- Improved error handling and recovery

### Technical Details

#### New Functions
1. `check_book_status(book_name, author_name)`: Analyze book's database state
   - Returns: exists, status, book_info, action, title, author
   
2. `print_book_status_table(books_status)`: Display pre-flight plan
   - Rich table with all book statuses
   
3. `process_books_batch(books_status, privacy, skip_completed)`: Execute batch processing
   - Returns: success, resumed, failed, skipped results
   
4. `print_final_summary(results)`: Display final results
   - Rich table with statistics and detailed lists

#### Decision Logic
```python
if status == "done":
    action = "skip"  # Don't re-process
elif status == "processing":
    action = "resume"  # Continue from last stage
else:
    action = "process"  # Fresh start
```

#### Result Tracking
- 4 categories: success (new books), resumed (incomplete books), failed (errors), skipped (completed books)
- Each category tracks: book, author, youtube_url, short_url, error (if failed), reason (if skipped)

### Performance

#### Resource Management
- Sequential processing (one book at a time) to avoid resource contention
- 5-second delay between books to prevent API rate limiting
- Timeout protection (1 hour max per book)

#### Future Enhancements (Planned)
- Parallel processing with worker pool (3-5 concurrent books)
- Smart scheduling (process at specific times)
- Cloud integration (AWS, GCP workers)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Web dashboard for real-time progress tracking

### Breaking Changes
- None (fully backward compatible)

### Deprecated
- None
